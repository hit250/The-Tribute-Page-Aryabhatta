                <h2>Time and place of birth</h2>
                <p><b> Aryabhatta mentions in the Aryabhatiya</b> that it was composed 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, when he was
                23 years old. This corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476.

                Aryabhatta provides no information about his place of birth. The only information comes from Bhaskara I,
                who describes Aryabhatta as asmakiya, "one belonging to the Asmaka country." During the Buddha's time, a
                branch of the Asmaka people settled in the region between the Narmada and Godavari rivers in central
                India; Aryabhatta is believed to have been born there.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Aryabhatta is the author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which are lost. His
                major work, Aryabhatiya, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was extensively referred to in the
                Indian mathematical literature and has survived to modern times. The mathematical part of the
                Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry. It also contains
                continued fractions, quadratic equations, sums-of-power series, and a table of sines.</p>

                <h2>Works</h2>
                <p>It is fairly certain that, at some point, he went to Kusumapura for advanced studies and lived there for
                some time. Both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as well as Bhaskara I (CE 629), identify Kusumapura as
                Pa?aliputra, modern Patna. A verse mentions that Aryabhatta was the head of an institution (kulapa) at
                Kusumapura, and, because the university of Nalanda was in Pataliputra at the time and had an
                astronomical observatory, it is speculated that Aryabhatta might have been the head of the Nalanda
                university as well.Aryabhatta is also reputed to have set up an observatory at the Sun temple in
                Taregana, Bihar</p>
